# Weather Watch

A simple watchface for Pebble with weather.

I prefer analogue watchfaces, however pretty much all of the ones available use full hands which then often obscure the extra information being displayed on the watch.  I created this one with hand indicators that only show near the outside.  This keeps everything nice and clean.

A typical view of the watch is as follows:

## Configuration

There are a number of configuration items available:

* Temperature unit (&deg;C or &deg;F)
* Battery status (you can choose to show the battery status always, never, only when charging or while it is less than a specified threshold)
* Hide/show temperature
* Hide/show weather conditions
* Bluetooth indicator (showing while connected or never showing)
* Bluetooth disconnect alert (choose a type of vibration alert when the watch loses bluetooth connectivity with your phone)
* Language

You can select to view the date in one of the following languages: Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish

It is intended for a future release to support Chinese, Japanese, Greek and Cyrillic based languages.
