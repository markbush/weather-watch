# Weather Watch

A simple watchface for Pebble with weather.

I prefer analogue watchfaces, however pretty much all of the ones available use full hands which then often obscure the extra information being displayed on the watch.  I created this one with hand indicators that only show near the outside.  This keeps everything nice and clean.

A typical view of the watch is as follows:

## Configuration

There are a number of configuration items available:

* Hide/show temperature
* Hide/show weather conditions
* Bluetooth indicator (showing while connected or never showing)
* Bluetooth disconnect alert (choose a type of vibration alert when the watch loses bluetooth connectivity with your phone)
